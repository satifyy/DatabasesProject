    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>This portal now mirrors the project spec workflows. Use the navigation above to move between the focused views instead of a single overwhelming page.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Manage Degrees</strong> – create degrees, tie courses to each degree, and map objectives per course.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage Courses</strong> – keep the course catalog and instructor roster accurate.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage Objectives</strong> – define learning objectives with short codes and unique titles.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage Semesters & Sections</strong> – add semesters, sections, and assign instructors with enrollment totals.</li>
        <li><strong>Associate Courses with Objectives</strong> – link any catalog course to the objectives it supports (independent of degrees).</li>
        <li><strong>Enter/Review Evaluations</strong> – drive the per-section evaluation workflow with summaries and completion status.</li>
        <li><strong>Run Queries / Reports</strong> – execute the required spec queries with SQL-side filtering and chronological ordering.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Work through the tabs from left to right when onboarding a new database: define master data, schedule sections, connect objectives, then enter evaluations and run reports.</p>
